## List 13 – Medieval German

### Generals and what they can command
The letters at the end of troop type description describe which gerneals can command them and not their origin as this is stated in the line if relevant. Hence:
<ol>
<li>Only [I, T] C-in-C can have any sub-generals (as per the list notes).</li>
<li>&quot;Allies internal to this list&quot; – This section specifies which combination of ally-generals may be used with which type of C-in-C.</li>
<li>A sub-general can be of any type. As a cnsequence the section for Free cantons should give sub-general costs as per [FC] CinC.</li>
  <ol>



War wagons lists as 1 per 4 foot if taken. This is for all foot but can only be commanded by [T, Ci] generals.

The standard wagons must remain in their respective commands as they can only be commanded by a general.

The army baggage command can only have &quot;other train and also foot elements&quot; that are not marked [I, T, Ci, FC] as these must be commanded by a general of that type.

The upgrade of Ps(S), Bw(I) and Bw(O) archers should be read as Ps(O), Bw(I) and Bw(O) (Probable mistake).

The upgrade of crossbowmen to handgunners is for foot only (Probable mistake as mounted crossbowmen mercenaries still existed at later dates).

The Bohemian mercenary crossbowmen should be treated as Bw(X) double based with Bw(O) with the appropriate costs.

The Spanish in Konradin&#39;s feudal army are a sub-list.

Where upgrades do not mention the origin then the origin remains unchanged.

A [T] general may be either feudal or a prince of the church. If the latter it does not trigger the Feudal troops minima.
