## List 13 – Medieval German

War wagons lists as 1 per 4 foot if taken. This is for all foot but can only be commanded by [T, Ci] generals.

The standard wagons must remain in their respective commands as they can only be commanded by a general.

The army baggage command can only have &quot;other train and also foot elements&quot; that are not marked [I, T, Ci, FC] as these must be commanded by a general of that type.

Only [I, T] C-in-C can have any of the sub-generals.

&quot;Allies internal to this list&quot; – This section specifies which combination of ally-generals may be used with which type of C-in-C. These are internal allies. Therefore no [I] ally general is allowed as this contradicts this section even though it is listed as an ally-general type.

The upgrade of Ps(S), Bw(I) and Bw(O) archers should be read as Ps(O), Bw(I) and Bw(O) (Probable mistake).

The upgrade of crossbowmen to handgunners is for foot only (Probable mistake as mounted crossbowmen mercenaries still existed at later dates).

The Bohemian mercenary crossbowmen should be treated as Bw(X) double based with Bw(O) with the appropriate costs.

The Spanish in Konradin&#39;s feudal army are a sub-list.

Where upgrades do not mention the origin then the origin remains unchanged.
